Your instructor will have prepared a programming activity for you today in which you will be able to use most of the Python skills you have developed so far this semester.  Be sure to ask questions as often as you have to, and remember that it's ok to experiment in code!  If you're not sure if something will work, try it out!  You can always erase it later.
