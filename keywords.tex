\chapter{Python Keywords}

\index{Reserved words|see {Keywords}}\addindex{Keywords}{Keywords} are words that have a special meaning in Python.  As discussed in XXXXX, we are not allowed to use keywords as identifiers.

This table was copied from this list at W3Schools: \url{https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp}.

Notice that all of these keywords consist completely of lowercase letters except for \texttt{False}, \texttt{True}, and \texttt{None}.
