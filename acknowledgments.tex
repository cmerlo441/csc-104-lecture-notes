\chapter{Acknowledgments}

My sincere thanks to my colleagues in the Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Information Technology, who encouraged me to apply for a sabbatical, and who taught my classes in my absence, so that I could prepare this material.  In particular, thanks to the members of the CSC 104 course committee, who helped guide me during some critical decision making.  Thanks also to the Nassau Community College Federation of Teachers' Sabbatical Committee, for their hard work to ensure that professors like me get the opportunity to do this kind of work.
